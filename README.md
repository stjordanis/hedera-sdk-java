# Hedera™ Hashgraph Java SDK

> The Java SDK for interacting with Hedera Hashgraph: the official distributed
> consensus platform built using the hashgraph consensus algorithm for fast,
> fair and secure transactions. Hedera enables and empowers developers to
> build an entirely new class of decentralized applications.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is currently under a re-development effort. The goals are as follows:

 * Native support for Android 19+

 * Native support for the Corda DJVM

 * Usage of modern Java techniques (such as futures) to reduce internal control flow complexities

 * End-to-end test coverage

 * Minimal breaking changes

Note that at the end of the effort the changes will be squashed to a single commit  on top of `master`
to preserve development history.

If you are trying this out and notice something missing from master, feel free to open an issue. It's likely
it was simply overlooked.

## Development

### Dependencies

 * [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) v12+ (note this is to _build_, not run)

### Compile

```sh
$ ./gradlew compileJava
```

### Unit Test

```sh
$ ./gradlew test
```

### Integration Test

Requires passing `OPERATOR_ID` and `OPERATOR_KEY` to system properties. Integration tests run against
the Hedera test network.

```sh
$ ./gradlew integrationTest -POPERATOR_ID="<shard.realm.num>" -POPERATOR_KEY="<PrivateKey>"
```

### Example

Most examples require `OPERATOR_ID` and `OPERATOR_KEY` to be in the environment. Some examples also
require `MIRROR_NODE_ADDRESS`. Examples are run against the Hedera test network.

```sh
$ export OPERATOR_ID="..."
$ export OPERATOR_KEY="..."
$ export MIRROR_NODE_ADDRESS="..."

$ ./gradlew -q example:run<NameOfExample>
$ ./gradlew -q example:runGenerateKey
```
